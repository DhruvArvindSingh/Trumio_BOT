# TrumioAI ChatBot - Ethos Hackathon Project

Welcome to the repository of our **TrumioAI ChatBot**, developed as part of the IIT Guwahati *Ethos* Hackathon. Our goal is to create a versatile chatbot that merges general conversational AI capabilities with advanced task-specific functionalities, aiming to revolutionize the way users interact with different platforms.

## Project Overview

The Multi-Purpose ChatBot combines cutting-edge technologies to serve a range of applications:

- **General Conversational AI:** Our chatbot is designed to handle everyday conversations, providing smooth and intelligent communication with users.
- **Task-Specific Functionalities:**
  - **PDF Image and Website Reader + Voice Bot:** The bot can extract and read PDF content and websites, converting text into speech, offering a user-friendly, voice-guided interface.
  - **LinkedIn Profile Extractor Bot:** A dedicated tool to extract and analyze LinkedIn profile information, offering valuable insights directly from the Streamlit app.
  - **Blockchain-Integrated Frontend and Backend:** Our system ensures decentralized and secure data management using blockchain technology, allowing smooth integration and further expansion into various use cases.

## Features

1. **General Conversational AI**
2. **PDF and Image Reader**
3. **Website Reader with Voice Narration**
4. **Chatbot for Conversational Interactions**
5. **LinkedIn Profile Extractor**
6. **Blockchain-Integrated Frontend and Backend**

## Future Vision

Our vision for this project goes beyond the current implementation. In the future, we aim to:

- **Extend Integration to More Platforms:** Incorporating integrations with social media, e-commerce, and educational platforms.
- **Enhanced Conversational AI:** Evolve the chatbot to handle more complex and natural conversations with NLP advancements.
- **Multi-Channel Communication:** Enable the chatbot to interact with users across various messaging platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, Slack, etc.).
- **AI-Powered Insights and Analytics:** Provide real-time analytics and recommendations based on interactions and profile data.
- **Voice and Video Assistance:** Expand the chatbotâ€™s capabilities to include video conferencing features for real-time support.
- **Blockchain-Driven Decentralization:** Leverage blockchain for secure, tamper-proof storage of user data, ensuring privacy and integrity in transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** (Backend)
- **FastAPI** (Python integration for task-specific functionalities)
- **Streamlit** (For LinkedIn Scraper Bot)
- **MetaMask** (For Ethereum wallet integration)
- **Ethers.js** (For interaction with Ethereum blockchain)
- **Sepolia Test** (Network (For testing smart contracts on Ethereum test network)
- **Blockchain Technology** (For decentralized frontend-backend system)
- **Speech Synthesis** (For voice assistance)
- **NLP & Machine Learning** (For conversational AI)

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v16.x or later)
- npm (v7.x or later)
- Python 3.x
- FastAPI dependencies (install via `requirements.txt`)
- Git

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thebinary110/Trumio_BOT
cd Trumio_BOT
```

### 2. Install Node.js Dependencies

Before running the project, install the necessary Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm express
npm cors
```

3. Configure MetaMask
Install the MetaMask browser extension.
Set up your wallet with the Sepolia Test Network.
Get test ETH from a Sepolia faucet to interact with smart contracts on the test network.

```

### 4. Run the Frontend

Return to the root project folder and start the frontend using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Access the Application

You can now access the Multi-Purpose ChatBot through your local environment:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`

## Future Enhancements

We are constantly evolving this project. Our future goals include:
- **Merging of the bots into one final bot and then adding our own build langchain self learning LLM into that and preparing the final bot**.
- **Seamless Integration with Additional Services** like Slack, WhatsApp, and Telegram.
- **Natural Conversation Flow:** Further refinement of NLP models for better conversation handling.
- **Task Automation:** Adding more task-specific bots for e-commerce, social media management, and more.
